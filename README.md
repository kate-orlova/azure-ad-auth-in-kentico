# Azure AD authentication in Kentico
Azure AD authentication in Kentico module implements an Azure Active Directory identity provider for Kentico to verify user accounts existing in a business directory and issue security tokens upon successful authentication of those users.

Prior to start integrating make sure that a Kentico application planning to outsource an authentication to Azure AD is registered in Azure AD first. Azure AD registers and uniquely identifies an application in its directory.
